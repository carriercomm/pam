# pam - packers and movers

A set of scripts that helped me backup my files and configurations so I could move from Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 to Kubuntu 15.10.

Almost all of the scripts contain hardcoded paths for my system. So, as such this repo is not meant to cloned and run on your machine. That said, the backup code itself is pretty generic so feel free to copy and modify it to suit your needs.
